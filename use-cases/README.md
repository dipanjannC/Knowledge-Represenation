# Agentic AI System Use Cases

This directory contains real-world use cases demonstrating how semantic data modeling enhances agentic AI systems.

## Customer Service Automation

### Problem
Traditional chatbots struggle with complex customer inquiries requiring domain knowledge and context understanding.

### Semantic Solution
- Model customer issues as semantic entities with relationships
- Define service capabilities and tool mappings
- Create knowledge graphs of products, policies, and procedures
- Enable agents to reason about customer needs and available solutions

### Benefits for LLMs
- Structured knowledge reduces hallucination
- Semantic queries provide accurate information retrieval
- Context-aware responses based on customer history
- Consistent reasoning across different agents

## Scientific Research Assistant

### Problem
Researchers need help finding relevant papers, identifying collaborators, and tracking research trends across multiple domains.

### Semantic Solution
- Research ontology with papers, authors, topics, methodologies
- Citation networks and collaboration graphs
- Semantic search and recommendation systems
- Cross-domain knowledge integration

### Benefits for Agentic Systems
- Intelligent literature search and filtering
- Automated hypothesis generation
- Research gap identification
- Collaboration opportunity discovery

## Enterprise Data Integration

### Problem
Large organizations have data silos making it difficult for AI agents to access and integrate information.

### Semantic Solution
- Enterprise ontology mapping data sources
- Standardized vocabularies across departments
- Semantic data pipelines and transformations
- Federated query systems

### Benefits for Multi-Agent Systems
- Consistent data interpretation across agents
- Automated data integration workflows
- Cross-departmental information sharing
- Scalable knowledge management

## Smart City Management

### Problem
Urban systems generate massive amounts of data requiring intelligent coordination and decision-making.

### Semantic Solution
- City infrastructure ontology (transportation, utilities, services)
- Event and incident classification systems
- Resource allocation and optimization models
- Citizen service request categorization

### Benefits for Autonomous Systems
- Real-time situation assessment
- Automated resource allocation
- Predictive maintenance scheduling
- Coordinated emergency response
