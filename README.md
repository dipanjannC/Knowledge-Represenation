# Knowledge Representation & Semantic Modeling

Practical guidelines and examples for building ontologies and semantic models that enhance LLM and agentic system capabilities.

## Purpose

This repository provides methodologies for creating formal knowledge representations that enable intelligent systems to reason effectively about data and relationships.

## Why It Matters

**For LLMs:**

- Reduces hallucination through structured knowledge
- Enables accurate retrieval-augmented generation (RAG)
- Provides verifiable knowledge structures for grounding outputs

**For Agentic Systems:**

- Facilitates tool selection and capability mapping
- Enables workflow orchestration and goal decomposition
- Supports multi-domain integration with consistent representations

## Technologies

**Formats:** OWL, RDF/RDFS, Turtle, JSON-LD, SPARQL, SHACL

## Focus Areas

- Domain modeling (healthcare, finance, IoT, enterprise)
- Knowledge graph construction
- AI/ML integration and semantic embeddings
- Agentic system support (capabilities, workflows, coordination)

## Quick Start

1. Explore `/examples` for practical implementations
2. Review `/docs/guidelines` for best practices
3. Use `/templates` for common patterns
4. Apply `/tools` for validation

## Learning Path

1. RDF and semantic fundamentals
2. OWL and ontology engineering
3. Knowledge graphs and integration
4. Advanced topics: reasoning, validation, optimization
